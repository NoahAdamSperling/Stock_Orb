# The Stock Orb :chart_with_upwards_trend::crystal_ball:
The Stock Orb is a Python script that utilizes a smart bulb to create a real-time visual indicator of percent changes in stock market data (i.e., a stock market lamp) relative to the prior day's closing price. This project uses a YeeLight brand smart bulb and the financial API Finnhub.

# Materials Needed
A YeeLight brand [smart light](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B91X2XQ).

A spherical [light fixture](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EMBZISM/).

*Although the spherical light fixture is not needed for the light to work, it is helpful for giving the final product a more crystal ball kinda feel :crystal_ball:.*
